## How to Use

1. **Browse Problems:** Start with the Basic Level and progress to more challenging problems.
2. **Write Solutions:** For each problem, create a `.c` file named as `problem_<number>.c` (e.g., `problem_01.c` for "Hello, World!").
3. **Compile & Test:** Use any standard C compiler (like `gcc`) to compile and test your solutions.
   ```sh
   gcc problem_01.c -o problem_01
   ./problem_01
   ```
4. **Learn & Experiment:** Modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.
